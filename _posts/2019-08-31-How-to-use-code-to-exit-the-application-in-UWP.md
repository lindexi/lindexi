I will tell you how to exit the application in UWP by the code.

We can call some static method to help us to exit the application.

The first method is as this code:

```csharp
            CoreApplication.Exit();

```

And the other one is 

```csharp
Application.Current.Exit();
```

If you are making the WPF application that you can use this code to exit the application.

```csharp
Application.Current.Shutdown();

```

And

```csharp
Environment.Exit(0);

```

If you find any problems, please contact me.
